# PCA Image Compression

This repository contains materials for demonstrating image compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The project includes a PowerPoint presentation explaining the concept and Python code for implementing PCA-based image compression.

## Project Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in various machine learning and data science applications. This project focuses on leveraging PCA to compress images by reducing their dimensionality while retaining essential features.

## Files in This Repository

- `P ca.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation that explains PCA.
- `code.py`: A Python script implementing PCA for compressing images.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaaado/Pca.git
   cd Pca
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
3. Change Image Path:
   ```bash
   image_path = 'your/path/to/img'
4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python code.py
5.View compressed images in the output folder or display them directly from the script.
